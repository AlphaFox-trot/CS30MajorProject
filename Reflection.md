I enjoyed coding this project, it was a fun learning experience, It was one of the first game creation project I saw throught to the end, sortof. This project is still not compleatly finished, and I do not plan on continuing this as it currently is. 
one issue I ran into is  the long journy it took to get all my arrays to interact properly. Another issue was properly creating the classes and getting them to work the way they do.
One of my favorite parts of this project was being able to get the arrays to interact once I finaly got it down the project became so much easyer and was so satisfing to watch in action.
